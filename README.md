**Abstract**

This report presents a detailed comparative analysis of three machine learning models—
Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, and Logistic Regression—applied to predict 30-day
patient readmissions using the Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD) for 2019. Each
model utilized various data preprocessing, feature selection, and modeling techniques to
understand and predict the risk factors associated with patient readmissions. The study
aims to assess the models' effectiveness in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, and
to identify the key predictors that significantly impact readmission outcomes. The analysis
also explores the strengths and limitations of each model, providing insights into their
practical implications for healthcare analytics and decision-makin.
